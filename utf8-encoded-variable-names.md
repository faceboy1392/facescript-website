# how would this work

so i kinda wanna do it like Julia

```julia
π = 3.14159

fun ∑(num1, num2) {
    # do something, i have no idea what sigma means in math
}
```

## Limitations: what cannot be in a variable or function or whatever name at all
```
( ) [ ] { } . , ;
```
spaces also arent allowed

## Limitations: what cannot be at the start of a variable name
```
- ! ~ # ' "
```


> not sure but it might be good to just disallow any symbol that is already used in the language, like operators and stuff
